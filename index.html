<p>My name is Amy Phan and currently I'm a fourth year computer science student at Cal Poly Pomona. WatchFinder was created as a application tool for many users such as myself to find my missing android wear watch whenever I would lose it around the house. WatchFinder is a project created for CS 499. Currently it is still in beta, and many more features will be added in the future.</p>

<h3>
<a id="future" class="anchor" href="#future" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Future</h3>

<p>Future implementations are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adding Bluetooth signal checker. This checks if your watch is still connected to your phone if so it will buzz your watch and phone.</li>
<li>Allowing different vibration pattern to suit your needs. </li>
<li>Adjusting vibration intensity so it's easier for users to hear the watch.</li>
<li>Pebble support. We hope to expand our app to other smart watches as well.</li>
<li>New features for this app will be implemented as android wear grows and evolves. </li>
</ul>
