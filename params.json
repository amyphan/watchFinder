{"name":"Watchfinder","tagline":"App on android to find your watch","body":"\r\n### Lost watch?\r\nNo problem! We have created a solution for you to find your watch now! With just your android phone you can now easily buzz your phone from your watch to help you find your android wear watch.\r\n\r\n### Solution!\r\nHow does this app work? We simply send an notification from your android phone to your android wear watch to  vibrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n### About\r\nMy name is Amy Phan and currently I'm a fourth year computer science student at Cal Poly Pomona. WatchFinder was created as a application tool for many users such as myself to find my missing android wear watch whenever I would lose it around the house. WatchFinder is a project created for CS 499. Currently it is still in beta, and many more features will be added in the future.\r\n\r\n### Future\r\nFuture implementations are the following:\r\n- Adding Bluetooth signal checker. This checks if your watch is still connected to your phone if so it will buzz your watch and phone.\r\n- Allowing different vibration pattern to suit your needs. \r\n- Adjusting vibration intensity so it's easier for users to hear the watch.\r\n- Pebble support. We hope to expand our app to other smart watches as well.\r\n- New features for this app will be implemented as android wear grows and evolves. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any questions or trouble feel free to contact me at aphan1993@gmail.com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
